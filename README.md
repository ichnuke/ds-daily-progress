# ds-daily-progress
I'm learning Python and Data Science from scratch with the goal of becoming job-ready.
This repository tracks my daily practice - real tasks, mini-projects, and explanations.
Every file shows my progress, thinking, and consistency.
I'm using tools like ChatGPT for feedback and guidance, but all code and learning is my own effort.
